# Overfitting:
# Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying patterns. When a model overfits, it performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on unseen or new data, which is the ultimate goal of machine learning models.
# To prevent or mitigate overfitting, you can employ various strategies:
#
# Use More Data: Increasing the size of your training dataset can help the model generalize better. With more data, the model is less likely to fit the noise in the training data.
#
# Feature Selection: Carefully select relevant features and remove irrelevant or redundant ones. Reducing the dimensionality of the data can help prevent overfitting.
#
# Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess your model's performance. Cross-validation helps estimate how well your model will generalize to unseen data.
#
# Regularization: Regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization add penalties to the model's coefficients, discouraging them from becoming too large. This helps control model complexity.
#
#
# Ensemble Methods: Use ensemble techniques like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting, which combine multiple models to reduce overfitting. These models are less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
#
# Data Preprocessing: Standardize or normalize your input data. This can help the optimization process and prevent the model from focusing too much on the scale of individual features.
#
# Dropout (for Neural Networks): In deep learning, dropout layers can be added to neural networks to randomly deactivate neurons during training, preventing them from relying too heavily on specific features.
