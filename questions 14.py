# Version control is a crucial aspect of software development that helps teams manage and track changes to their codebase over time. It offers several benefits, including collaboration, code backup, code history, and the ability to manage and deploy different versions of a software project
# Purpose of Version Control:
# Backup and Recovery: Code and project files are stored in a central repository, making it easy to recover previous versions in case of data loss or mistakes.
#
# Branching and Experimentation: Version control systems support branching, allowing developers to work on new features or experiments in isolation. This enables safe exploration and testing of different code paths.
#
# Code Quality: Developers can review and discuss changes before merging them into the main codebase. This promotes code quality and ensures that only well-tested and reviewed code is integrated.

# Basic Steps to Commit Changes using Git:
#
# Initialize a Git Repository (if not already done):
# If you're starting a new project or working on an existing one, you can initialize a Git repository in the project's root directory using the following command:
# git init
# Add Changes to the Staging Area:
# Before committing changes, you need to stage them. Use the git add command to specify which files or changes you want to include in the commit. For example, to stage all changes, use:
#
# git add .
# To stage specific files, replace . with the file names.
#
# Commit Changes:
# Once your changes are staged, you can commit them along with a meaningful commit message that describes the purpose of the commit. Use the git commit command:
#
#
# git commit -m "Add new feature"  # Replace the message with a descriptive one
# View Commit History:
# You can view the commit history, including commit messages and the authors, using:

# git log

# Push Changes to a Remote Repository (Optional):
# If you're working in a collaborative environment or want to keep a backup of your code on a remote server (e.g., GitHub or GitLab), you can push your commits using:
# git push origin master  # Replace 'origin' and 'master' with your remote and branch names

# These are the fundamental steps for committing changes in Git. Committing frequently and providing clear, concise commit messages is a best practice in version control to maintain a clean and organized history of your project's development.
