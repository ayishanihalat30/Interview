# Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two fundamental paradigms in machine learning, and they differ in how they handle labeled data and their goals.
#
# Supervised Learning:
#
# Labeled Data: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset that includes both input features and their corresponding target labels. Each data point in the training dataset is labeled, which means the algorithm knows the correct answer for each input.
#
# Goal: The primary goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input features to target labels. It aims to make predictions or classifications based on this learned mapping.
#
# Examples:
#
# Classification: Given a dataset of emails (features) labeled as spam or not spam (target labels), a supervised learning algorithm can learn to classify new, unlabeled emails as spam or not.
# Regression: Predicting the price of a house (target label) based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
#
# Unsupervised Learning:
#
# Unlabeled Data: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset that consists only of input features without any corresponding target labels. The algorithm has to discover patterns or structures within the data on its own.
#
# Goal: The primary goal of unsupervised learning is to uncover hidden structures or relationships in the data. It doesn't aim to make predictions or classifications with labeled data.
#
# Examples:
#
# Clustering: Grouping similar customer profiles from a dataset of purchase histories based on their shopping behaviors without prior knowledge of customer categories.
# Dimensionality
# Reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving its important information. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an example of unsupervised dimensionality reduction.
# In summary, supervised learning deals with labeled data and aims to make predictions or classifications, whereas unsupervised learning operates on unlabeled data to discover patterns or structures within the data. These two paradigms are essential in the field of machine learning and are used in various applications depending on the nature of the problem and the availability of labeled data.
